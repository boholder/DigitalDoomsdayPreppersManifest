# Awesome Offline

Electricity is easily to access, but the Internet is not. Prepare for the loss of Internet.

This is a digital doomsday preppers manifest. Here are some useful and free offline e-resources to help you get an information advantage in an environment without the Internet, but with electronic devices and electricity.

**Contributions are welcome**, which is why I don't choose the Gist, because it doesn't have PR mechanism. Let's expand it together.

## Integration Projects

* [Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)](https://internet-in-a-box.org/)
  * "A 'learning hotspot' that brings the Internet's crown jewels to those without Internet."
  * Created with the goal of providing education to children in developing countries, the project integrates a variety of resources including [Kiwix (Offline Wikipedia)](https://www.kiwix.org/en/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)... it even contains the source code of some famous projects. It is a good way to start hoarding knowledge.

## Knowledge

### General

* [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/en/) -- Multiple out-of-the-box knowledge sets of [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)'s content with reading applications for almost all platforms.

### Medical

### Education

* [Kolibri](https://learningequality.org/kolibri/) -- An ed-tech platform created by [Learning Equality](https://learningequality.org/) that allows for education videos and exercises like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) to be used offline.

### Geography

* [OpenStreetMap Vector Tiles](https://openmaptiles.org/) -- Map layers based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and other free maps data, which can be hosted locally for other devices access. You can create your own layers based on existing layers and data schema. (Most of layers need to be purchased, but at least we can download some free maps.)

* [Using OpenStreetMap offline](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_offline) -- Official guide.
